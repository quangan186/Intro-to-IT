                      <h3>Bui Quang An</h3>
                      <p>My name is Bui Quang An and my student number is s3877482. I used to study and graduate from Nguyen Thi Minh Khai high school in Ho Chi Minh City. I have many hobbies such as playing basketball, playing soccer, playing guitar, listening to music, etc. I started to be interested in IT when I was in grade 11.  At that time, when my father took me to the IT class, I started to use my computer for different purposes, not only for playing computer games. When I made my first own games, I began to realize the beauty of IT and my passion for IT appeared. Right now, as a freshman, I only know how to make websites or games through programming languages such as Javascript and using HTML, CSS, or using Gamemaker Studio to develop my own games. In the future, I want to understand more about IT fields and have more experience gained from studying RMIT so that after graduating, I can have a stable job with a high income.
 </p>


                      <h3>Duong My Uyen</h3>
                      <p>My name is Duong My Uyen, and I am a first-year RMIT student with the sID s3904418.
                        After graduating from high school in Canada, I began my undergraduate studies at RMIT. To keep myself entertained, I enjoy baking sweets, watching my favorite singer's shows, playing rhythm games, learning Japanese, and listening to music. I used to dislike programming languages and anything IT-related until I was 17 when my Computer Science teacher showed me the beauty of the subject and the IT profession, and I fell in love with it. Following the course, I realized that IT is absolutely my cup of tea, and I chose Computer Science as my university major. At present, I have a rudimentary understanding of Java, which I learned in high school, as well as Python, SQL, and HTML, which I learned at university. I hope that by the end of my time at RMIT, I will have a better grasp of the IT profession and will be able to work in the field I enjoy as a full-stack developer. </p>


                      <h3>Nguyen Phuoc Thanh</h3>
                      <p>After graduating high school, I started studying RMIT in 2020 with my student identity as s3878144. Though having few interesting hobbies, I spend time doing workouts, reading, and cooking as a means to relieve stress and to entertain myself. Before enrolling in the IT major, I was lost at determining whether to choose the Logistics or Computer Science field so I tried various experiences, and with the help from the lecturers, interaction with my fellow classmates, the knowledge I accumulated I finally realized that Information Technology is the field I should follow. Right now, as a freshman, I only have little knowledge about data structuring using SQL queries, basic programming with Python but I have good data visualization and data handling skills to create insights, which I am pretty proud of. In recent years in RMIT, I would like to study more about Data Analysis expertise and have more experience gained from interacting with the experts, all for the future with the finest preparation.

                      <h3>Pham Phuc Binh</h3>
                      <p>My name is Pham Phuc Binh and my student ID is s3501362. I am an ordinary student and I have many hobbies such as reading and activism, especially playing video games with friends. I have used and worked with computers from an early age so I have much passion for technology. In 2016, I saw that the first time an AI program called AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol, the 1st Go player. Defeating the world's number one Go player is a significant milestone for artificial intelligence. Since then, AI has piqued my interest. Specifically, I was looking for information on artificial intelligence technology, which is expected to have a significant impact on human life in the future. As a result, I enrolled at RMIT University to study information technology. I believe that this course will help me greatly in understanding artificial intelligence technology, as well as in furthering my research in this area.

Even though everyone has other courses’ assignments, they still spend a little time every day doing the report and project so that they can finish the assignment earlier with good quality. If we do not have any deadlines in other courses, we could do the project better from the user interface to the contents in order to help users have a good experience.

                      <p>As a newbie in the IT industry, it is difficult for me to determine my future jobs at the moment. However, if I had a chance, I would like to become a game developer and work for famous companies such as Ubisoft, Sony, VNG, etc. due to my hobbies since I was a four-year-old child. In my opinion, focusing on programming courses including Introduction to Programming, Programming 1, Practical Database Concept, and Mobile Application Development will play an important role which is the first step to achieve my dream.
</p>


                      <h3>Duong My Uyen</h3>
                      <p>A full-stack developer is a person who can work on both the front-end and back-end. In the future, I want to become a full-stack web developer for Techbase Vietnam, a company that has a great working environment. In order to achieve my goals, having a basic knowledge of database learning in the Practical Database Concept course, and the knowledge of developing web learning in the Web Programming course will be the first step to achieve my dream. I expected that after graduation, I would have knowledge of some of the programming languages required, be able to build the UI, and be ready for my internship. </p>


                      <h3>Nguyen Phuoc Thanh</h3>
                      <p>Entering the Data Science field needs you to hone a variety of skills from your aimed domain and analytic skillsets. To work in corporations like VinBigData as a Data Engineer, I have been learning Python from the ‘Introduction to Programming’ course and SQL programming languages and aim to get past the beginner stage after. I expect to grasp the basics of business mathematics within 1 year from now and the basics of computing mathematics after researching the ‘Algorithms and Analysis’ course in IT minor. Domain knowledge (business, banking, etc.), to what I believe, can only be learned from working.
 </p>


                      <h3>Pham Phuc Binh</h3>
                      <p>My goal is to become an AI engineer who works in problem-solving or Artificial Intelligence technology fields. They navigate traditional software models as well as Machine Learning models. With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in various areas of the IT industry, there is a high demand for these IT professionals. We must have some technical and non-technical AI skills to become an AI engineer including Programming languages: Python, Java, C++. These are some popular languages I can choose to learn to start with AI. Algorithms and  Mathematics. You must have a good knowledge of algorithms to create a model or an existing one. Analytical skill is an important skill because an AI engineer has to analyze big data. </p>

                        <p class="text">Students can learn lectures online especially IT through our website, which is currently under construction. To learn the lesson, customers can access our website from any location and at any time using their devices such as cellphones, laptops, or tablets. Only by logging into their account on the website can students select lessons. As a result of this service, we hope to assist students in planning their educational path and improving their IT knowledge from a young age. Assigning homework is the only way for students to learn new chapters. Additionally, we have a team of consultants who are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week to help students with their learning and plans.
As technology advances, online learning services are becoming more and more important to students' educational needs. When customers use our services, they'll be fully supported by our team of professionals. Best educational solutions have always been our goal. Parental time and money are saved by using our service compared to traditional services. With mobile devices such as laptops and mobile phones, children and college students can also learn all subjects at any time. The number of IT training centers in Vietnam, such as Green Academy and Aptech FPT, is on the rise., and we hope to capture a portion of it so that the system can grow.

                        <p class="text">Vietnamese like me recognize the need for additional education, especially in information technology, as well as the importance of continuing education. Information technology engineers are a serious shortage of human resources in Vietnam. Because of this, we aim to provide a service for online learning that meets the needs of today's learners. Parents send their children to private lessons in the majority of cases, according to a youth newspaper survey. A global trend toward online learning is emerging as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. This site will hopefully help students acquire knowledge and become familiar with new learning methods instead of traditional ones.

While An thought about what project his group should do, he was using W3School, a popular web with many developers, to teach his friend to develop a basic website using HTML, CSS. The format of the project is similar to the format of W3School but we change the sequence of lessons which is based on the courses in RMIT University and feedback from students . While our group did the project, we have researched other people and it seems our idea currently has no competitors.

                    <!-- Detailed description -->
                      <h3 id="small-title">2. Detailed Description</h2>
                        <!-- Aim -->
                        <h4>a. Aims</h4>
                        <p class="text">Acquiring knowledge has never been easier since the digitalization era. With the help of the Internet, tens of millions of people around the world have registered in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) offered by many MOOC providers and other platforms. However, knowledge involving technology, in general, will require your brain to adapt cognitive frameworks and spend consistent time programming. In this project, we decided to develop a website called “TeachIT”. The platform will provide a learning ground for pupils to upload or view notes - harnessed through both internal and external resources conducted by other pupils, not from instructors. And the best part is, there’s no bar for expertise. Everyone can choose to upload something as little as tips for “making tools” or as huge as “developing hardware”. Hence, students are able to review what they learn in a lecture class and simplify those out-of-space coding exercises.
 </p>

                         <p class="text">Programming doesn't need to be exhausting and every course permits you to implement your understanding into something live so that there's "learning" yet in addition "doing". This website is the ideal instance of "getting it going." It simply doesn't let you feel pressured with lots of courses, yet rather guides students to what is reasonable for themselves and cracking that afterward. Courses mostly come with an interactive community so that students can discuss the course and come up with solutions together. Regardless of doubts, problems, or a success to share, the community is a befitting place for that. Each of the courses comes with small assignments, and you get individual assistance from the support team. The subjects are constructed towards unlocking your succeeding career within the tech industry, determining how to solve business crises. They explain a wide range of concepts revolving around their vital focus, and the greatest part is, the courses are updated monthly.

                        </p>

                        <p class="text">Doing exercise after the lesson may not be enough. Therefore, the application should have a test function that students can check their understanding after finishing the exercises or after reading a lesson.
Its purpose is to check how much the students can understand. It can be used after the lesson or exercises or every time when the students want to test themselves. It is necessary because the exercises may not be enough to check the understanding and they may need tests to see how much they have understood the course. Therefore, students are able to know what they are good at and what they need to improve.

 </p>

                         <p class="text">The application will include a "Subscription" feature in which students (the administrators) can make a profit. Whenever we want to publish their works on the site,  this function can be used to publish our products. There are many projects that can be produced and applied for any purpose while attending university, these projects can be creative and practical for daily life. Therefore, it would be unfortunate if these ideas or projects are skipped while they can be improved in quality. We can work on projects and receive experience dealing with clients about our works. This would also assist us in improving the quality of the applications, as we would be able to study and work at the same time while attending university. Aside from learning IT-related skills, we can gain business experience and learn to collaborate with a variety of people, all of which can benefit our future careers.

                        </p>
                        <!-- Plans and progress -->
                        <h4>b. Plans and progress</h4>
                        <p class="text">The idea of this website came up coincidentally after I taught his friend about how to make a basic website. While I used the W3Schools website to help my friend study basic knowledge to make the website, I found that there was some basic knowledge and the sequence study about HTML and CSS in W3School are complicated for students to understand. Therefore, I suggested making a website which teaches IT to my group and my team members agreed to choose it as our project which can help a number of students in various fields in RMIT solve their difficulty in studies, not only for students but also for SAS problems when they do not have enough teachers to support students.
 </p>

                       <p class="text">The website will include all courses of Information Technology based on what students learn at RMIT University. Moreover, in order to make our web different from the W3School, we add tutorial videos to summarize what they have read so that it can reduce the boredom of the lesson. Also, as we know that many students in RMIT have to post to ask anyone who has learned their course to give them samples to do their assignments, the website will have a section that contains sample tests in diverse fields, and students are comfortable practicing themselves or use it to do their group assignment. Furthermore, we create a place where students can share their feelings, questions, and comments about the website so that we can improve the quality of our web.

                       </p>

                       <p class="text">In order to create this website, knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript plays a crucial role that every member of my team needs to learn. Also, we need to research to know the course students learn in their disciplines and synthesize the theories and exercises they learn so as to paraphrase them as easily as possible to help everyone understand. Furthermore, based on the research, we might change the sequence of the lesson to be suitable for students.
                      </p>

                      <p class="text">After that, designing the website in such a way that captivates the users and symbolizes RMIT’s uniqueness is detrimental to the success of this project. We need to find or take photos of RMIT views and use them to decorate the website. When the website is finished, we will invite some people to test it to find bugs and have feedback from them to fix and improve it before publishing. Besides, we also need some of my friends to support us in advertising the website and to give advice about web design.

                      </p>

                      <p class="text">After having been accepted by team members, I started to plan to develop the web. The biggest advantage for me is that I used to join some projects and develop a website in the previous semester break with my friends which helped me have more experience to design the web front-end.  After planning step-by-step to make a website, I presented it to my teammate and we started to divide tasks to each other. According to career plans, Uyen wants to be a full-stack developer and I think this project is a good practice for her to improve her experience and make her CV become better when she applies for jobs in the future; thus, I ask her to support me to code the web. On the other hand, as I mentioned before, Binh’s strength is writing reports. I think he will be suitable to do the research to synthesize the knowledge from students in the various fields and paraphrase it to help students understand easily. Last but not least, Thanh will help Binh to do the research and take photos of RMIT’s views for me and Uyen to do the web and he will also support me in developing the web.

                      <p class="text">The first step that our group does is making a survey for students in RMIT to find out the essential functions that our web needs to have. After collecting all the surveys from students, we had a meeting to have an overview and choose the functions which are vital to our web. There are 3 main functions including application function, user function, and admin function. In the application function, it has 2 features which are View courses and Forum. View course will help users read the lessons in many courses such as Software Engineering, Information Technology, Robotics, etc. while Forum will create a place where students can discuss and share their ideas in their study with each other. User function will have 2 main features including account profile and login website. The account profile will determine the user’s level to give the different benefits for them. For instance, if the account is registered by using the RMIT account, this account will be in the VIP rank and users can view all the lessons and videos in different courses while the other accounts will see the limited lessons and they cannot watch the video lessons. The last function is the admin function and it will also have 2 features: create courses and lessons and user accounts management. The Create courses and lessons feature will help the admin users (our group) post new courses and lessons while the user accounts management will help admin grant permissions and make decisions for the user accounts such as upgrading to VIP, banning and deleting accounts, etc.


                      </p>

                      <p class="text">The next step is collecting the sources which are IT courses, lessons, and exercises in RMIT university. In this stage, Binh and Uyen will take charge and they will do the research on other students and note the courses and lessons and feedback of the courses they are learning such as what they struggle with the courses and the solutions to make it better. Next, they will spend the amount of time paraphrasing the contents and sorting them before they give me to add them to the web.



                      </p>

                      <p class="text">The pre-final step is developing the web UI and testing the website before hosting in public. Before designing the website, I asked my friend to help Uyen draw a prototype and choose materials such as colors, images, icons, etc. Next, we will develop the website based on the prototype. According to our experience, Thanh and I will take charge of developing the web’s functions. I will do the web function and user function while Thanh will do the admin function. On the other hand, Binh and Uyen will design the web UI by using HTML and CSS.



                      </p>

                      <p class="text">The final step before hosting the website is that we will invite some IT students in the RMIT to test and give feedback for us to fix bugs and complete our product. While we check again, we might add some animations to make the web more attractive. Moreover, I will ask my classmate who is studying at RMIT to help me advertise my web before hosting.



                      </p>

                      <p class="text">In this project, our aim is that it can help students study better and support teachers in SAS when they do not have enough people to help students. So far, even though we still have a lot of assignments in different courses, we have completed the prototype of the website and if we have more time, we will start to design and develop the web.

                        <h5 id="small-title3">Website Administrator</h5>
                        <p class="text">This is the individual that takes control of the platform and inspects the content. He or she has editorial rights over the content, the website, and manages the history of users involved in contributing to the website. Needless to say, the domain name is inseparable from the website so the administrator will register the name in one-year terms with a subscription fee deducted to pay for and can renew the domain as long as the budget is suffixed. Binh will be in charge of this role with his flexible reflex in problem solving and creativity in reports.
 </p>

                        <h5 id="small-title3">Web Developer</h5>
                        <p class="text">The web developer takes charge of constructing the hardware and programming framework for the site. This contains the server is up 24/7 and guarantees stable internet connections to the server. The web engineer likewise regularly configures the web facilitating server like setting up email accounts, or changing the DNS, albeit at times the administrator would arrange these things themselves. Although An has the ambition to join the game development field, it shares some similar characteristics with the web Devs. Therefore, he will be assigned this role to set up basic tools (FTP, email server, web server, database, DNS, etc.).
</p>

                        <h5 id="small-title3">Full-stack Developer</h5>
                        <p class="text">If the website developer creates the frame for this website then the full-stack developer ensures the integrity of the exterior design and manages the database. As a future position Uyen dreams of, there is no doubt she will take this role. Occasionally, the administrator (Binh) has to limit unnecessary functions to ensure the server is ready for action. Uyen will help ensure the server is up as well, yet in addition offers specialized help on the most proficient method to utilize essential facilitating apparatuses, for example, help signing in, setting up email accounts, transferring records through Git/GitHub, and setting up your DNS effectively.
</p>

                        <h5 id="small-title3">Data Scientist / Search Engine Optimization Specialist</h5>
                        <p class="text">This position is essential for optimizing the functional and user experience of the project. He/She utilizes the system database to provide insights for future updates as well as create algorithms to assist users on the search options menu so that it occurs on the first option of search engine searches with minimum keywords based on users’ trends, searches, etc. This role will help Thanh who wants to become a data engineer defines the finest path towards his data science career.

                        <!-- Scope and limits -->
                        <h4>d. Scope and limits</h4>
                        <p class="text">TeachIT covers all of the technology-based courses offered at RMIT with the experiences coming directly from students and backed by the RMIT library. Hence, the quality of courses is not high or expert-based. Users can select the skill they are interested in with a wholesome of activities involving recording video, try and retry as many times as they like. We will prioritize courses quantitatively before optimizing the platform’s user experience. Moreover, TeachIT supports only Vietnamese & English.  </p>

                        <!-- Tools and technologies -->
                        <h4>e. Tools & technologies</h4>
                        <p class="text">The first thing to do, we will write down the ideas by visualizing them with Figma. The process provides necessary sketches and prototypes needed for the understanding of each member. As stated from the previous sections in 5.2, we will choose a website-builder for WordPress (Elementor) and implement coding knowledge learned (mostly CSS, HTML, and JavaScript) to customize the user interface and user experience. When the frame for public viewing is ready, we will implement Git/GitHub as our file-uploading system. Last but not least, testing is one last part of the project guaranteed to run smoothly but it gets expensive the more you invest in it. As for TeachIT, we will make use of services from Browsershots to function with the least spend.
</p>

                        <!-- Testing -->
                        <h4>f. Testing</h4>
                        <p class="text">In this project, the purpose is to create a learning site for IT students. Therefore, the website will synthesize knowledge about each of the courses and give users some exercises under each lesson. For that reason, the product needs to be tested by three groups. The first group will be us, the creators of the product will test how the product works and predict any errors that users could make. The second group will be the lecturers who will check the quality and also the accuracy of the lessons posted on the website and the assignments posted after each lesson. I believe checking the lesson's material should be done while the application is being developed. The information or the knowledge may not be absolute, but it should still be logical and students can read and understand it. This will also reduce the time for the second team to check the product. The final group will be the students, which is also the major user group of this application. Therefore, user testing is needed in this application. According to Jakob Nielson of user testing, we only need 3 to 5 participants from each group for user testing. When testing the users, 5 participants will give enough information about how the user would interact with the application and what kind of error they would make.
Plan: There are multiple courses in this application, therefore, we need at most five users for user testing for each course. User testing will be done on the campus computer lab. Before the test takes place, there will be 2 team members who will be in charge of setting up the computers, checking the network connection, and instructing the participants about the test. There should be 2 users testing at the same time; the user testing should take 10 to 15 minutes for each person. We will give the users the lecture of their courses and ask them to finish a small exercise under the lesson to check their understanding and also how they interact with the user interface.
The project will succeed if our application can run smoothly without any bugs. Secondly, we received good feedback from the user, and last, the website is able to be used widely by the students.

                        <h4>h. Risks</h4>
                        <p class="text">Risks are possible to have whenever we are making the projects. The obstacles could be anything that prevents us from finishing the project. One of the obstacles we may face during this project is first to come from us, we may have some misunderstandings and miscommunication with each other. During building the project, every member should be involved in completing it and contact each other when necessary. Therefore, a meeting once or twice a week should be organized to prevent this risk because it could also cause delay. The second risk that could happen is our inadequate skills in the software, hardware, or the tools and technologies involved. Since most of the teammates are new to the project and so is the IT program, the risks can come from the lack of knowledge. Because there is lots of software that we have not approached which makes it difficult for us to decide what kind of technologies are required in this project, which can take a long time for us to master the skills.

                        <!-- Group Processes and Communications -->

                        <p class="text">In the “Risks'' part, we mentioned how miscommunication can affect our project. Therefore, we had created a group on Facebook Messenger, since our common social platform is Facebook and we will use the Facebook Messenger app for communicating and a meeting is scheduled every Tuesday at 7 p.m. The main content of the meetings is to summarize what the members have done. At the same time, members will ask some questions related to the project, which include the difficulties of each member when doing their tasks as well as ideas that can contribute to the project. If there are one or two members who cannot attend, the meeting should still go on with two members, what happens at the meeting will be summarized and we will use the “tag” function from Messenger to make an announcement for them. If there is no response from the absent members, we will try to private message them or email them to remind them what they should do. Besides the meeting day, if the member has any questions, they can leave the message in the chatbox and we will have a small discussion later.

                    <p class="text">In order to make the website and host it, there are many tasks that we have to do and we think there are 4 important parts to develop it. To begin with, the web front-end design is very vital which plays a crucial role in the success of the web. If the web is beautiful and eye-catching, it will be attractive to not only users but also investors who want to improve the web further; thus, we need a web designer to solve this part and An will be the most suitable choice based on his experience. Secondly, the website will contain a huge volume of data and it can be dangerous if any hackers decide to attack the web. Therefore, a backend developer will be essential so as to avoid cyberattacks and manage the data such as the user’s accounts so that the web will not crash because of hackers. In this case, Thanh will be a good choice. Thirdly, we need a person who will do the research in public to understand user experience to develop the web that solves what the user needs and synthesize the content for the web and this job will be suitable for Uyen due to her good connection in public which is beneficial to advertise our website. Last but not least, we need a person who will sort the content and paraphrase it before giving it to me to put it on the web and Binh will be a good choice to work in this part.

                    <p class="text">After 5 weeks of working together, our group has overcome a lot of challenges. In those challenges, my part was doing the Team profile, Tools, Skills, and Jobs section. Moreover, because my idea was chosen, I did the Plans and Progress part in the Detailed Description section. Furthermore, as a leader, I had to make a suitable plan for my group, checkup our workload in order to remind teammates, and check if there are any mistakes in the report. About Thanh and Uyen, even though they have to learn other courses which are very difficult, they collaborated to finish the complicated section such as Detailed Description, which has a lot of parts and huge effects on the whole report. Also, Thanh is very trustworthy which is shown in our meeting that he is a person who gives me advice and suggestions to help our group work better while Uyen is enthusiastic that she usually contacted me to ask if there was anything that she could help with for the report. Last but not least, despite having trouble with teammates in other courses and other works, Binh completed his tasks which are Project Description and Overview on time and it impressed me.</p>

                    <h3 id="small-title2"> Duong My Uyen</h3>
                    <p class="text">Everybody had done their best to finish the project, I do not have any complaints because all the team members have been doing well, even though all of us have other courses that need to be done but the process is going well and the tasks are finished in time, the team members are friendly and that is the important part. An is my leader, he had done a great job of dividing the work to each team member and following on our process to make sure that everybody got what they should do and understood the task. Moreover, he also helped other team members to fix some small mistakes in our paragraphs In drafting the report, I was assigned to work with Thanh, he helps me a lot in building the idea for the application and completed his task in time, he is the person who came up with many wonderful ideas which help our project become more interesting. Finally, Binh is also a great team member. I used to work with him from last semester and he is a wonderful team member who always does the work. In this project, he had some difficulties with other courses but he still tried his best to make it on time.

                    <p class="text">Upon individual view, the experiences and work process of ones go flawlessly with little to non-obstructions forestalled. Notwithstanding, when dividing errands between individuals the viewpoint of that part will impact intensely, bringing about an exposition quick however non-intelligent, lacking motivation and high possibilities of making basic mistakes. Then again, working in a gathering effectively supports utilizing numerous points of view. This will expand one's perspective and be adaptable in utilizing an assortment of standards actually while working on the working of the gathering and the nature of its work.

                    <p class="text">It's great to be grouped with the members. Although we had problems with online discussions, we still got great feedback from members. Personally, I feel a bit shy because I am assigned a lighter task than the members of the team, which is Project description and overview. In fact, it's a pretty easy job to just put up with general ideas in the project. I commend An for taking on the great responsibility of leading the team to complete the project on schedule. Uyen and Thanh also gave wise opinions at decision times. I didn't have too much trouble giving a description of the project. I got a lot of support in brainstorming from team members. This is an interesting experience that can help me practice my teamwork skills as well as communicate with colleagues.

                    <p class="text">Overall, I think our group works very well on the assignment.  We have good communication with each other and we are respectful to the idea that we share in the meeting. Firstly, we have agreed that on Tuesday every week, we organize meetings through Messenger to discuss and report what we have done. After that, if anyone does not send the part they made in the report, I will extend it for them until Thursday to submit what they have done on the report before I fix and design it again. Moreover, if anyone has a misunderstanding or any problems, we will support each other in order to finish the task perfectly. However, there are some points that we need to improve. For instance, because I am the only one who knows and has experience in developing the web, I cannot do the project due to the lack of time and we have to use Figma to make the prototype of our project. Also, because of the different difficulties in other courses, our group process was slightly slower than what I guess and plan. The thing that makes me surprised about my group is that they respect and trust me to let me lead them in the assignment. Our group members are the key to help me understand the value of working as a team and the responsibility in working to make everyone have the motivation to increase their productivity.
 </p>

                    <h3 id="small-title2"> Duong My Uyen</h3>
                    <p class="text">I believe I did a decent job on this assignment; the tasks I was given were finished on time. Everything has gone well, and thanks to our weekly group meetings and our leader, there has been no miscommunication between us, which is the riskiest thing when working in a group. We expected the project to be completed quickly, but due to everyone's other course assignments, the procedure for this assignment took longer than intended. What I found surprising about our group is that everyone works extremely well together during the process of working together, even though there are many tasks to be completed. I don't feel under any pressure when working in the same group as everyone. Working with a group has taught me a lot as a first-year student, notably how to manage time, plan and arrange work correctly, and strike a balance between work and rest.

                    <h3 id="small-title2">Nguyen Phuoc Thanh</h3>
                    <p class="text">The downside would be individuals' disciplinary foundations influencing their contribution to this task and distinctive day-by-day time management had enormously diminished the speed of preparing the assignment. Needless to say of the slow Internet connection throughout Viet Nam, I believe the efficiency can be higher with the increase of teammates’ intimacy.  </p>

                    <h3 id="small-title2"> Pham Phuc Binh</h3>
                    <p class="text">In the end, we completed the project in the best way possible. Everyone put in a lot of effort to overcome the challenges we faced. A number of meetings were required before we could come up with the best possible solution. An has been a good leader. He did a good job of dividing the work and keeping an eye on the project's progress. Besides, the remaining members have also successfully completed their assigned tasks. The team worked well together despite the fact that everyone was very busy with other projects. While studying for the final exam, I was able to improve both my teamwork abilities and my information technology knowledge. When I first met them, I thought they were very responsible and nice people.
