                      <h3>Duong My Uyen</h3>
                      <p>My name is Duong My Uyen, and I am a first-year RMIT student with the sID s3904418. 
                        After graduating from high school in Canada, I began my undergraduate studies at RMIT. To keep myself entertained, I enjoy baking sweets, watching my favorite singer's shows, playing rhythm games, learning Japanese, and listening to music. I used to dislike programming languages and anything IT-related until I was 17 when my Computer Science teacher showed me the beauty of the subject and the IT profession, and I fell in love with it. Following the course, I realized that IT is absolutely my cup of tea, and I chose Computer Science as my university major. At present, I have a rudimentary understanding of Java, which I learned in high school, as well as Python, SQL, and HTML, which I learned at university. I hope that by the end of my time at RMIT, I will have a better grasp of the IT profession and will be able to work in the field I enjoy as a full-stack developer. </p>

In the future, I want to become a full-stack web developer for Techbase Vietnam, a company that has a great working environment. In order to achieve my goals, having a basic knowledge of database learning in the Practical Database Concept course, and the knowledge of developing web learning in the Web Programming course will be the first step to achieve my dream. I expected that after graduation, I would have knowledge of some of the programming languages required, be able to build the UI, and be ready for my internship. </p>

                        <!-- Testing -->
                        <h4>f. Testing</h4>
                        <p class="text">In this project, the purpose is to create a learning site for IT students. Therefore, the website will synthesize knowledge about each of the courses and give users some exercises under each lesson. For that reason, the product needs to be tested by three groups. The first group will be us, the creators of the product will test how the product works and predict any errors that users could make. The second group will be the lecturers who will check the quality and also the accuracy of the lessons posted on the website and the assignments posted after each lesson. I believe checking the lesson's material should be done while the application is being developed. The information or the knowledge may not be absolute, but it should still be logical and students can read and understand it. This will also reduce the time for the second team to check the product. The final group will be the students, which is also the major user group of this application. Therefore, user testing is needed in this application. According to Jakob Nielson of user testing, we only need 3 to 5 participants from each group for user testing. When testing the users, 5 participants will give enough information about how the user would interact with the application and what kind of error they would make.  
Plan: There are multiple courses in this application, therefore, we need at most five users for user testing for each course. User testing will be done on the campus computer lab. Before the test takes place, there will be 2 team members who will be in charge of setting up the computers, checking the network connection, and instructing the participants about the test. There should be 2 users testing at the same time; the user testing should take 10 to 15 minutes for each person. We will give the users the lecture of their courses and ask them to finish a small exercise under the lesson to check their understanding and also how they interact with the user interface. 
The project will succeed if our application can run smoothly without any bugs. Secondly, we received good feedback from the user, and last, the website is able to be used widely by the students.

                        <!-- Risks -->
                        <h4>h. Risks</h4>
                        <p class="text">Risks are possible to have whenever we are making the projects. The obstacles could be anything that prevents us from finishing the project. One of the obstacles we may face during this project is first to come from us, we may have some misunderstandings and miscommunication with each other. During building the project, every member should be involved in completing it and contact each other when necessary. Therefore, a meeting once or twice a week should be organized to prevent this risk because it could also cause delay. The second risk that could happen is our inadequate skills in the software, hardware, or the tools and technologies involved. Since most of the teammates are new to the project and so is the IT program, the risks can come from the lack of knowledge. Because there is lots of software that we have not approached which makes it difficult for us to decide what kind of technologies are required in this project, which can take a long time for us to master the skills.

                        <!-- Group Processes and Communications -->

                        <p class="text">In the “Risks'' part, we mentioned how miscommunication can affect our project. Therefore, we had created a group on Facebook Messenger, since our common social platform is Facebook and we will use the Facebook Messenger app for communicating and a meeting is scheduled every Tuesday at 7 p.m. The main content of the meetings is to summarize what the members have done. At the same time, members will ask some questions related to the project, which include the difficulties of each member when doing their tasks as well as ideas that can contribute to the project. If there are one or two members who cannot attend, the meeting should still go on with two members, what happens at the meeting will be summarized and we will use the “tag” function from Messenger to make an announcement for them. If there is no response from the absent members, we will try to private message them or email them to remind them what they should do. Besides the meeting day, if the member has any questions, they can leave the message in the chatbox and we will have a small discussion later.

                    <p class="text">Everybody had done their best to finish the project, I do not have any complaints because all the team members have been doing well, even though all of us have other courses that need to be done but the process is going well and the tasks are finished in time, the team members are friendly and that is the important part. An is my leader, he had done a great job of dividing the work to each team member and following on our process to make sure that everybody got what they should do and understood the task. Moreover, he also helped other team members to fix some small mistakes in our paragraphs In drafting the report, I was assigned to work with Thanh, he helps me a lot in building the idea for the application and completed his task in time, he is the person who came up with many wonderful ideas which help our project become more interesting. Finally, Binh is also a great team member. I used to work with him from last semester and he is a wonderful team member who always does the work. In this project, he had some difficulties with other courses but he still tried his best to make it on time.

                    <p class="text">I believe I did a decent job on this assignment; the tasks I was given were finished on time. Everything has gone well, and thanks to our weekly group meetings and our leader, there has been no miscommunication between us, which is the riskiest thing when working in a group. We expected the project to be completed quickly, but due to everyone's other course assignments, the procedure for this assignment took longer than intended. What I found surprising about our group is that everyone works extremely well together during the process of working together, even though there are many tasks to be completed. I don't feel under any pressure when working in the same group as everyone. Working with a group has taught me a lot as a first-year student, notably how to manage time, plan and arrange work correctly, and strike a balance between work and rest.
